Since Ra was now in the form of a man, he could no longer stay young forever. He was bound to grow old one day. After ruling Egypt for many thousands of years, that time finally came. At his old age, Ra began to notice that his people no longer respected him. They laughed at him. They mocked him. They said, \"Look at Ra! Ra is so old! His bones are like silver, his flesh like gold, and his hair the color of lapis lazuli!\" They also said, We cant go on like this. We need a new leader.",

By the Fifth Dynasty in the 25th and 24th centuries BC, he had become one of the most important gods in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the noon sun.

Set scattered the pieces all over Egypt, and Osiris’s wife Isis spent years searching for them. Eventually, Isis put her husband back together, binding him in cloth to make the first mummy, but Osiris only came partially back to life.

By the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055 – 1650 BC) he was replaced by Osiris in his role as lord of the underworld. One of his prominent roles was as a god who ushered souls into the afterlife. He attended the weighing scale during the Weighing of the Heart, in which it was determined whether a soul would be allowed to enter the realm of the dead. Despite being one of the most ancient and one of the most frequently depicted and mentioned gods in the Egyptian pantheon, Anubis played almost no role in Egyptian myths.",
